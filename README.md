# ASCII Utils

ASCII Utils is a collection of useful
cross-platform scripts for displaying
ASCII pictures.

```bash
  asciiwrite
    <in_file>
    <out_file>
```

The tools are written using the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library and use
[AALib](
  https://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib).

On Android the programs depend on
the
[SDOtool](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/sdotool)
input automation tool, in order to properly
hide the software keyboard when displaying images
in a framebuffer terminal.

## Installation

The tools in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The collection has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`ascii-utils`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  ascii-utils
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[ascii-utils-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ascii-utils-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
